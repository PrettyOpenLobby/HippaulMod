// autoupdate.cpp -- replace our own PolHook.dll from the server, then tell the
// user to restart. Checks shortly after launch and then every
// [autoupdate] interval_min minutes for as long as the Viewer is open.
//
// The interval was added 2026-08-17. A POL session is long -- the Viewer gets
// opened once and left up -- so a launch-only check meant a build published in
// the evening reached nobody until the next restart, which on the machine the
// shim is developed on could be the following day. Each check is one 64-byte GET
// of the .sha256 unless it differs; interval_min=0 restores the single check.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS THE SHIM'S JOB
//
// The Viewer's own patch channel CANNOT update this file on Windows, and that is
// structural rather than a bug we can fix server-side. `pol.exe` statically
// imports PolHook.dll -- it is the FIRST entry in its import table -- so the file
// is MAPPED for the whole life of the process. polcore (the patcher) stages a
// `.tmp2` and then tries to MoveFileEx over the live file, which Windows refuses,
// and the Viewer reports "failed to replace polhook.dll" on every launch. That is
// why the PS2 mirror's W2U-1000 `meta.json` has `latest_version` rolled back as a
// brake, and why the publish script refuses to publish into that tree.
//
// The asymmetry we exploit: **Windows forbids OVERWRITING a mapped file but
// ALLOWS RENAMING one.** So we never write over ourselves. We rename the live DLL
// out of the way and move the new one into its place. The running process is
// completely unaffected -- its image is already mapped, and a mapping survives a
// rename of the underlying directory entry -- so this is safe to do while the
// very code doing it is executing. The next launch loads the new file.
//
// This is the same trick `setup.cpp` uses (MoveFileA on PolHook.dll), which is why
// PolShimSetup.exe can update a Windows install and the patch channel cannot.
// Wine/Proton permits replacing a mapped file outright, which is why the Deck was
// never blocked and Windows always was.
//
// ORDER OF OPERATIONS, and why each step is where it is
//
//   1. hash the DLL ON DISK -- not our own build number. If a previous launch
//      already staged an update that the user has not restarted into, the on-disk
//      file already matches the server and we must do nothing. Comparing against
//      the RUNNING build would re-download it on every launch forever.
//   2. fetch <base>/PolHook.dll.sha256, compare. Equal -> done, nothing fetched.
//   3. fetch <base>/PolHook.dll and verify it against the hash we were just told.
//      A body that does not match is a truncated or tampered download and is
//      dropped -- this is the only integrity check in the chain, because the
//      transport is plain HTTP (there is no TLS anywhere in this stack).
//   4. refuse to go BACKWARDS (see the build marker below).
//   5. write PolHook.dll.new beside the live file -- same directory, therefore the
//      same volume, so the rename in step 6 is atomic rather than a copy.
//   6. rename live -> PolHook.dll.b<NN>.old, then .new -> PolHook.dll, rolling the
//      first rename back if the second fails. The window in which the install has
//      no PolHook.dll is two adjacent MoveFileW calls wide, and a failure there
//      restores the original rather than leaving the Viewer unlaunchable.
//
// PROGRESSIVE STAGING (added with the boot guard)
//
// A staged update no longer ends the session's checking. The worker keeps
// running on its interval, and because step 1 hashes the DISK, a build published
// after the stage simply differs again and replaces the staged file -- the swap
// is even safer the second time, since a staged-but-never-booted DLL is not
// mapped by anyone. Two consequences worth naming:
//
//   * the shim tracks whatever the server CURRENTLY advertises, not the first
//     thing it saw. The .sha256 is singular -- the server has exactly one
//     current build -- so "match the server" is the whole contract. That also
//     makes a server-side brake work: republishing an older (but >= running)
//     build un-stages a bad one on every machine that has not restarted yet.
//   * the file being renamed aside may itself be a staged build, so its backup
//     name comes from ITS marker, not from the running build's number, and the
//     boot-guard sentinel keeps pointing at the session's known-good copy.
//
// THE BOOT GUARD (autoupdate_boot_guard / the .staged.ini sentinel)
//
// Updating is a two-phase commit now. install_new() writes a sentinel beside the
// DLL recording what was staged and where the known-good copy went. The NEXT
// launch -- which is the first time the staged code actually runs -- counts its
// boot in the sentinel, and the build must then CONFIRM itself by surviving
// confirm_ms (default 20 s, past the window where hook installs and EAT patches
// run) or by exiting cleanly (a crash never reaches DLL_PROCESS_DETACH --
// cl_filter hands the exception on to WER, which terminates without notifying
// DLLs -- so a clean detach IS evidence of health; a sub-5 s exit proves nothing
// and is ignored, because pol.exe's single-instance stub loads us and exits
// cleanly within a second). Confirmation deletes the sentinel. rollback_after+1
// boots without a confirmation restore the known-good copy and QUARANTINE the
// bad build's hash: the worker refuses to re-download it until the server
// publishes something different.
//
// What the guard cannot cover: a staged DLL the LOADER rejects (corrupt PE,
// missing import). pol.exe then dies before any of our code runs, including the
// guard. The sha256 check upstream means such a file was published broken, not
// corrupted in flight -- that class is the publisher's to catch, not ours.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
//
// It does not restart the Viewer. Relaunching means getting past pol.exe's
// single-instance mutex, which the process we are inside still holds, and the
// mask guard has already cost this project one class of zombie that held exactly
// that mutex. Telling the user is cheap and correct; driving it is not.
//
// TWO THINGS THAT CAN UNDO A SUCCESSFUL UPDATE, both known and neither fixable here:
//   * Check Files / MSI self-repair restores what the SERVED manifest says
//     polhook.dll should be, and that manifest is the braked patch tree.
//   * A user who runs PolShimSetup.exe with an older embedded DLL and --no-update.

// patches.cpp -- persistent byte patches applied to POL modules post-unpack.
//
// app.dll ships ASProtect-packed (POL1 section), so these bytes do not exist in
// the file on disk -- they only appear once the stub has unpacked .text. That is
// the same constraint probes.cpp lives under, so we hang off the same hook: each
// module's first DllGetClassObject, which is post-unpack and pre-login.
//
// WHAT THIS FIXES -- (1) the pre-login "Check Files" list (sites A/B below), and
// (2) a NULL write in SE's FFXI Test Server case that crashes GM Call's request
// form (site D, below the table's comment for it).
//
// Site C, which rewrote the sign-up wizard's "https:%s%s" to http:, is gone:
// the server now terminates the wizard's SSL 3.0 with a certificate chain the
// stock cert.db trusts, so the wizard runs as SE shipped it. inject.cpp's
// patch_signup_scheme still makes the same rewrite when [polshim]
// signup_http=1, as a fallback.
//
// The enumerator walks the content table from data/doc/sqpolcts.bin (ids 1,2,3,4,
// 5,6,7,10,11,12,13,14,15,999,1000..1005) and marks every candidate "rejected" via
// a Product\%04d registry check that fails for essentially everyone. app.dll then
// runs a HARDCODED CHAIN of per-id cases, each of which may undo that rejection:
//
//     dec eax; je ...        id 1    FFXI
//     dec eax; je ...        id 2    Tetra Master
//     sub eax,0xc; je ...    id 14   Friend List
//     dec eax; je ...        id 15   FFXI Test Server
//     sub eax,0x3d8; je ...  id 1000 Navigator
//     cmp [ebp+8],4 ...      id 4    Front Mission Online   <- the fall-through case
//
// Fantasy Earth is id 11 and has NO case, so it keeps the rejection and is dropped
// before the client even opens its directory. Site A NOPs the `jne` guarding the
// fall-through case, so every id that reaches it gets the reprieve. CONFIRMED live
// 2026-08-11: Fantasy Earth then appears in Check Files.
//
// Site B is a genuine one-instruction bug in SE's code. Ids with their OWN case
// branch away before reaching site A, so site A cannot help them -- and Friend
// List's case clears only *esi (the status) and never *ebx (the reject flag),
// unlike Tetra Master (-> and [ebx],0) and FMO (mov [ebx],edx). Fixing it is
// correct but currently moot: Friend List ships no file.txt, and the LAST gate
// opens <installdir>\file.txt and requires it non-empty, so it is dropped there
// regardless. Site B is off by default for that reason.
//
// Everything here is RVA-based against the unpacked image and verified byte-for-
// byte before writing, so a different build fails safe instead of corrupting code.

// start shows no "beta test is installed" error; the same launch later in the
// same session does -- while the log still says "filecheck_all: applied" from
// startup. Site A is what clears that flag (it NOPs a `jne` so id 11 falls into

// this function has therefore never once fired -- no log on this box has ever
// carried a "page had been RESTORED" line. What actually happens is that a failed
// title launch UNLOADS and re-LOADS app.dll wholesale; the new mapping is original
// because it was just read off disk, not because anyone rewrote our bytes. That
// case is handled by patches_forget_module + the injector's re-hook, above.
// Keep this function anyway: it is cheap, and it is the only thing that would
// catch a genuine in-place rewrite if one ever does turn up.

// Cheap enough to call from a hot path: a memcmp of <=22 bytes per site, and

// (comtrace) because that recurs constantly and, more to the point, a content

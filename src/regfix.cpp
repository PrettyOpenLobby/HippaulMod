// regfix.cpp -- registration repair.
//
// Titles whose FILES are present but whose registry entries are missing (games copied
// to a new machine / Steam Deck without a real install) don't appear in the games menu
// and can't launch, because the Viewer gates on HKLM\SOFTWARE\PlayOnlineUS, not on disk.
// This detects such titles and WRITES the missing keys so they register.
//
// Runs at startup on the PolHook proxy -- before pol.exe's entry, so writes land before
// the client reads/enumerates. A real WRITE (not the in-process serve regredir uses)
// because the menu ENUMERATES InstallFolder; a synthetic value would need enumeration
// hooks too. pol.exe is elevated (and on the Deck HKLM is the writable Wine prefix).
//
// IMPORTANT: "ONLY EVER CREATES A MISSING VALUE" WAS THE BUG, not the safety property, and this
// header said it for months. On a machine where SE's own installer ran, every value is
// PRESENT -- so create-if-absent is a no-op precisely where a repair is needed, and both
// Fantasy Earth and FMO shipped broken to a second machine because of it (2026-08-18). Values whose CONTENT this file knows are now ENFORCED, not merely created:
// see repair_contents_guids. Everything else is still create-only.
//
// Records what it changed to a sidecar (regfix-added.txt beside the DLL). A value we
// CREATED is recorded as `subkey|name` and [regfix] clean=1 deletes it; a value we
// CORRECTED is recorded as `subkey|name|oldvalue` and clean RESTORES the old value,
// because those keys were SE's before they were ours.
//
// Four tiers are written per title:
//   * InstallFolder\NNNN + (for COM-launched titles) ContentsCLSID\NNNN / ContentsIID\NNNN,
//     the latter pair enforced against this file's table rather than merely created;
//   * the Interface\NNNN <-> patch.ver version stamp, made to AGREE (see repair_patchver);
//   * HKCR\CLSID\{...} class registration for the titles whose enumerator arm calls
//     ProgIDFromCLSID -- FFXI, Tetra Master, Friend List (see repair_comclass). Without
//     it the title is dropped from Check Files entirely, which is what hid Tetra Master
//     on the Steam Deck. Product\NNNN is still not written; nothing has shown it required.
//   * FMO ONLY: FrontMissionOnline.dll's JP->US interface GUIDs, on disk, with file.txt
//     moved in the same step (see repair_fmo_iids / fmoiid.cpp). The one tier that edits
//     a game file, and the one the patch server cannot be relied on to deliver.
//
// CAVEAT on [regfix] clean=1: the sidecar records VALUES, so clean removes the values we
// added but leaves the (now empty) CLSID subkeys behind. Harmless -- ProgIDFromCLSID
// fails on a key with no ProgID value, so the undo is functionally complete. It does NOT
// undo the FMO DLL patch either; FrontMissionOnline.dll.orig and file.txt.orig are the
// backups for that, exactly as the offline patch script's --revert uses.

//     the same value). So we adapt the FILE to the registry instead -- re-encrypt

// and holds the stock {6560D1E0-...}. The title therefore counted as "complete already",
// nothing corrected it, and the corrected GameStart interface {30B9D121-...} this table
// has carried all along was never written. comtrace's contentiid_alias then retries the
// failed activation with the stock IID, whose slot 3 is a GUID-comparing stub rather
// than GameStart, and returns E_NOINTERFACE. FE does not launch.
//

// "the case that actually matters, PRESENT BUT WRONG, was skipped every single time" --

// regfix cares about is present; presence is not evidence of correctness.

// REJECTED, so the id is dropped before the client ever looks at its folder. Note
// only Tetra Master's arm is region-indexed; FFXI's and the Friend List's GUIDs are

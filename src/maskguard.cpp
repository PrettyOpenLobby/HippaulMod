// maskguard.cpp -- keep the Viewer's PlayOnlineMask* window ALIVE from process
// start, and optionally keep it out of a one-window compositor's way.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Reported on a real Steam Deck in Game Mode, 2026-08-15:
// launching Fantasy Earth or Front Mission Online under gamescope KILLS THE MASK
// WINDOW, and the Viewer then raises an error dialog and exits. FFXI, which does
// not go through the same window juggling, launches fine on the same machine.
//
// The mechanism that fits every fact currently in hand -- and this file's log
// lines are what will CONFIRM OR KILL it, because nothing below is measured yet:
//
//   * pol.exe registers the mask class at 0x0041C455 and its wndproc 0x0041BEC4
//     is a bare `jmp [DefWindowProcA]` thunk (measured). So a close request from a window manager is DESTRUCTIVE by
//     default: DefWindowProc turns WM_CLOSE into DestroyWindow, and there is no
//     application code anywhere in the path to refuse it.
//   * polcore is handed that HWND -- IPOLCoreCom::SetMaskWindowHandle (slot 22)
//     -- and IPOLCoreCom::CreateInput (slot 12) is bound to it, verified
//     identical across four sessions. Once the window is destroyed, polcore holds
//     a dangling handle and the next Show/Hide/IsVisibleMaskWindow has nothing to
//     act on. "Mask dies -> error -> exit" is exactly that shape.
//   * gamescope displays ONE window. A borderless screen-sized overlay at (0,0),
//     owned by a process that also owns a game window, is precisely the case a
//     one-window compositor has to arbitrate -- and the Viewer is a shell that
//     swaps between three such windows per title launch.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT PART OF d3d8hook.cpp's MASK HANDLING. `tame_mask_window()` is
// only reachable from a successful windowed CreateDevice/Reset or the d3d9 path.
// A launch that dies BEFORE device creation therefore gets no mask handling at
// all -- and leaves no `[d3d] mask window` line either, so the log cannot even
// say what happened. That gap was flagged earlier and it is exactly
// the window in which FE and FMO are dying. This file arms from process start
// instead, so the mask is guarded from the moment it exists.
//
// The two coexist by design: THIS file owns the mask's SURVIVAL, d3d8hook owns
// its GEOMETRY once a game window exists. Subclasses chain -- we go on first and
// `install_msgspy` goes on over us, calling back through -- so neither has to
// move and d3d_unmask keeps working unchanged.
//
// [dx] mask_guard
//   0  off -- the pre-build-24 behaviour exactly.
//   1  DEFAULT. Watch and protect: subclass the mask as soon as it appears, log
//      its whole lifecycle, refuse WM_CLOSE / SC_CLOSE under a compositor -- AND,
//      since 2026-09-07, HOLD THE INVARIANT below: the mask is never on top,
//      never opaque, never in Alt+Tab and never the foreground window, for the
//      whole life of the process, whatever the Viewer or a title does to it.
//   2  = 1 plus shrink it to 1x1 off-screen at birth, so a one-window compositor
//      (gamescope) cannot pick it even as an invisible window. Deck A/B setting.
//
// THE INVARIANT, AND WHY IT LIVES HERE (2026-09-07). "The POL mask takes over my
// whole screen when I launch Fantasy Earth" came back for the Nth time. Every
// earlier fix sat on a TITLE-DEPENDENT path: d3d8hook's tame_mask_window() runs
// from a successful CreateDevice, on a branch chosen by the caller's return
// address and by whether the title is "excepted" or "native-windowed". For FE
// that chain is structurally dead -- it asks for a windowed device itself, so it
// takes the pass-through branch; that branch's mask arm is gated on `excepted`,
// which FE is not; and with Ashita in the process the return address names
// Ashita.dll anyway. The one attempt to un-gate it (build 161) crashed FE and was
// never committed. Meanwhile the mask has ALWAYS been born as a 1920x1080
// WS_EX_TOPMOST popup, and at mask_guard=1 nothing touched that style: the Viewer
// shows it at title launch (SetWindowPos SHOWWINDOW|NOZORDER|NOACTIVATE, measured)
// and a black topmost screen-sized window is the result. Alt+Tab "does not work"
// because whatever you switch to lands UNDER a topmost window.
//
// So the rule moved to the one place that sees the mask from its first message
// to its last, for every title, on every path: its own window procedure.
//
//   * At arm(): WS_EX_LAYERED alpha 0 (paints nothing), WS_EX_TRANSPARENT
//     (click-through), WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW minus WS_EX_APPWINDOW (no taskbar button,
//     no Alt+Tab entry), WS_EX_NOACTIVATE (never picked as the next foreground
//     window when a title's window closes -- the measured way it became the
//     foreground window mid-FE), and WS_EX_TOPMOST stripped.
//   * WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING: an HWND_TOPMOST insert is rewritten to
//     HWND_NOTOPMOST and SWP_NOACTIVATE is added. Geometry is NOT touched: the
//     Viewer may size it to the screen all it likes, an alpha-0 click-through
//     tool window that size is harmless, and d3d8hook's alignment (which exists
//     for polcore's cursor mapping on Tetra Master, not for the screen) still
//     owns the rect when it runs.
//   * WM_STYLECHANGING (GWL_EXSTYLE): the bits above are re-imposed on whatever
//     anyone writes, and WM_STYLECHANGED re-asserts alpha 0 (a freshly-set
//     WS_EX_LAYERED starts opaque).
//   * WM_MOUSEACTIVATE -> MA_NOACTIVATE, and d3d8hook's [foc] hooks refuse
//     SetForegroundWindow / BringWindowToTop / SetActiveWindow aimed at it
//     (maskguard_refuse_activation).
//
// This is exactly the style d3d_unmask=2 has applied AFTER CreateDevice on TM
// and FMO for weeks, so its safety is measured, not argued; the only change is
// WHEN (from birth) and WHO (this file, unconditionally). It does not hide the
// window: SW_HIDE black-screened the display on 2026-08-18 and the Viewer asks
// polcore IsVisibleMaskWindow. An alpha-0 window is still IsWindowVisible.
//
// WHY SWALLOWING WM_CLOSE UNCONDITIONALLY WAS WRONG -- measured 2026-08-15, and
// the reason the deferred-honour machinery below exists.
//
// This file used to argue: DestroyWindow does NOT send WM_CLOSE -- it sends
// WM_DESTROY -- so the Viewer's own teardown of its own mask never travels
// through the message we eat, and a WM_CLOSE here can only have come from
// OUTSIDE the application. The first half is true of DestroyWindow. The
// conclusion is false: **pol.exe's own shutdown closes its mask with WM_CLOSE.**
//
// Refusing it hung the Viewer on every ordinary exit. The mask is the LAST
// un-owned top-level window the process owns, so its destruction is what ends
// the message loop; with it refused, no WM_QUIT is ever posted, GetMessage never
// returns 0, ExitProcess is never reached, and pol.exe sits in the background
// with ~23 threads and one invisible window -- still holding the `PlayOnlineUS`
// single-instance mutex, so the NEXT launch dies a few calls in (a
// self-inflicted wound). Five armed sessions,
// perfect correlation:
//
//     [mask] WM_CLOSE ... REFUSED   reached [mask] summary (i.e. exited)
//     0  (pids 390928/446576/448956)     yes, 3/3
//     1  (pids 414736/363388)            no,  0/2
//
// An EXTERNAL WM_CLOSE was never credible for those two either: the mask is
// created `visible=0`, and nothing outside the process can click or Alt+F4 an
// invisible window.
//
// THE FIX IS NOT "STOP REFUSING". On the Deck the refusal is the whole point, and
// there is no message-level way to tell a compositor's WM_CLOSE from the Viewer's
// own -- both arrive at this wndproc as a bare WM_CLOSE, and InSendMessage()
// cannot separate them (winex11 delivers a WM close request from inside the
// process too). So the discriminator is not WHO SENT IT but WHAT ELSE IS LEFT:
//
//   * The Viewer is shutting down  -> the mask is the only un-owned top-level
//     window the process still has. Measured on the hung pid 363388: EnumWindows
//     returned PlayOnlineMaskUS and a `Default IME` owned BY it, nothing else.
//   * A compositor is killing the mask mid-session -> the shell window or the
//     game window is still there beside it. This holds during a title launch too,
//     which is exactly when the Deck bug bites, and it does not depend on that
//     window being VISIBLE -- EnumWindows returns hidden top-level windows, so a
//     shell that hides itself behind a game still counts as alive.
//
// So a refused close is not final, it is PENDING: refuse it now, and let the
// watcher honour it later if the mask is still the last window standing after
// [dx] mask_close_grace ms. Honouring is a PostMessage of the same WM_CLOSE with
// a bypass flag set -- posted, not DestroyWindow'd, because DestroyWindow is only
// legal on the thread that created the window, and the mask belongs to the
// Viewer's UI thread. That thread is still pumping (the hung process reports
// Responding=True; the hang IS its message loop waiting for a WM_QUIT that never
// comes), so the post lands. Since the mask class's wndproc is a bare
// DefWindowProcA thunk, letting the WM_CLOSE through is exactly a DestroyWindow
// -- the delay is the only difference from never having refused it.
//
// Two safeties, both because a false honour re-opens the Deck bug:
//   * The grace clock RESETS the moment any sibling top-level window reappears,
//     so a shell that swaps windows during a title launch can never mature it.
//   * A close is never honoured until a sibling has been seen at least once, so
//     an early-startup transient (mask up, main window not yet created) cannot
//     mature it either.
//
// [dx] mask_close_grace = 0 restores the old refuse-forever behaviour exactly.
//
// WHY MODE 2 SHRINKS RATHER THAN HIDES: the Viewer asks polcore
// IsVisibleMaskWindow, and a window put down with ShowWindow(SW_HIDE) could
// answer that differently. A 1x1 window off-screen is still visible, still
// hit-tests, still has a valid HWND -- it is only unpaintable and unpickable.
// The cosmetic cost, on every platform, is that the mask no longer blacks out the
// desktop during a transition. Since 2026-09-07 that cost is paid in every mode
// >= 1 (the invariant above), so mode 2's only remaining difference is the shrink.

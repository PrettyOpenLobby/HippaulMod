// vidfit.cpp -- place a title's DirectShow FMV through the GRAPH's own
// interfaces, instead of pushing its window around from the outside.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, AFTER d3d8hook.cpp's adopt_video_proc already tried
//
// The window route (EnumWindows -> find a "VideoRenderer"/"FilterGraphWindow"
// -> SetParent + SetWindowPos) is a guess in three places, and every one of them
// was measured wrong at least once:
//
//   * WHICH WINDOW. The class depends on the renderer the graph resolved to, so
//     the matcher needs a list that can never be complete (2026-08-17: FMO's is
//     FilterGraphWindow and there is no VideoRenderer window in the process).
//   * HOW BIG THE MOVIE IS. A window rect is the renderer's DEFAULT frame, not
//     the video: both titles sit at 320x240 outer / 304x201 client, and neither
//     number is the movie.
//   * WHETHER IT IS A WINDOW AT ALL. A VMR in WINDOWLESS mode has no video
//     window -- it composites into the application's own surface -- so there is
//     nothing to enumerate and no amount of window poking can move the picture.
//
// DirectShow answers all three exactly, and the calls are the ones the title
// itself should have made:
//
//   IBasicVideo::GetVideoSize          -- the movie's true dimensions
//   IVideoWindow::put_Owner            -- what SetParent was imitating
//   IVideoWindow::SetWindowPosition    -- in the owner's CLIENT coordinates
//   IVMRWindowlessControl9::SetVideoPosition  -- the windowless equivalent
//
// HOW WE GET THE GRAPH
//
// comtrace.cpp already sits on every CoCreateInstance in the process, and a
// title builds its graph through exactly that call. Measured on a live session:
//
//   [com] CoCreateInstance clsid={E436EBB3-524F-11CE-9F53-0020AF0BA770}
//         iid={56A868A9-0AD4-11CE-B03A-0020AF0BA770} -> OK
//         from=FE_Client.dll+0x33CE7
//
// -- CLSID_FilterGraph, IID_IGraphBuilder, from Fantasy Earth. So the object we
// need is handed to us on a path we already own; nothing has to be searched for.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
//
// It does not build, run, seek or stop anything -- the title owns playback. This
// only ever answers "where should the picture be", which the title got wrong for
// one reason: it computed the placement from the fullscreen rect it believed it
// owned, and we took that fullscreen away when we forced it windowed. Every call
// here is idempotent and re-checked on a poll, so a title that repositions its
// own video wins the next tick and then agrees with us.
// SHIPPED OFF, 2026-08-17. d3d_fitvideo defaults to 0 everywhere.
//
// This feature has produced two regressions and one crash and has never once
// been observed to IMPROVE a movie, so the burden of proof is on turning it on.
//
// What the last live run established (build 38, FMO):
//
//   [vidfit] graph ...: WINDOWLESS movie is 800x600, game client is 1084x813
//            -> (0,0 1084x813) filling the client  (was 0,0 799x599)
//
// Exactly ONE placement -- the place-once rule works, and the fight was not a
// re-placement loop. The renderer is WINDOWLESS, which is the part that matters:
// a windowless VMR has no window of its own, it composites into the GAME'S
// window. Enlarging its destination rect from 800x600 to the whole client does
// not "position the movie" -- it hands the movie every pixel the game draws to.
// The user's report ("I dismiss it and it forcefully comes back") is consistent
// with the video repainting over the game across the full client, and the
// session then died with no crash record.
//
// HYPOTHESIS, not measured. What would settle it: whether the picture the user
// sees after dismissing is a live movie or a stale frame, and what the title
// does with the graph on dismiss (stop, or leave it running).
//
// The real question is not "where should the rect be" but "who owns the surface
// after the clip ends", and answering that needs the title's playback lifecycle,
// not a geometry calculation. Until someone has that, OFF is the honest default:
// an FMV in a corner is cosmetic, an FMV painted over the game is unplayable.
#include "polshim.h"
#include <dshow.h>
// d3d9.h BEFORE vmr9.h: the VMR-9 headers declare methods taking
// IDirect3DSurface9/IDirect3DDevice9 and do not include d3d9.h themselves, so
// on its own vmr9.h is a wall of C2061s. This is a separate translation unit
// from d3d8hook.cpp, whose hand-declared d3d8 ABI must never meet a real header.
#include <d3d9.h>
#include <vmr9.h>

// The graphs we have seen. Small and fixed: a title rebuilds its graph per clip,
// so this is a ring of the most recent ones rather than a registry.
#define VIDFIT_MAX_GRAPHS 8

// PLACE ONCE, THEN LEAVE IT ALONE.
//
// The first version re-imposed placement on every 500 ms tick whenever the video
// was not where we wanted it. That is a FIGHT, and we win every round because
// ours is always the last write: dismissing an FMV in Front Mission Online moved
// the video and we dragged it straight back, half a second later, so the movie
// could not be skipped at all (reported live, 2026-08-17). put_WindowStyle
// forcing WS_VISIBLE made it worse -- even hiding the video did not stick.
//
// "Where should the picture be" is worth answering ONCE per clip. A title moving
// its own video afterwards is a decision, not a mistake for us to correct. The
// only thing that legitimately invalidates our answer is the GAME window changing
// size, so that -- and only that -- re-arms us.

// PUT THE WINDOW AWAY WHEN THE CLIP ENDS.

// Measured 2026-09-26 from a player's problem report (native Windows, b179):
// Fantasy Earth's opening movie was
// placed at (0,33 800x533) over the 800x600 client, and for the rest of the
// session the pointer showed ONLY in the 33px letterbox band at the top. The log
// holds ~7,700 `SetCursor(NULL) by quartz.dll+0xE28F7`, every one after the
// placement: the renderer window was still a VISIBLE child over the game, and it
// blanks the pointer over itself on every WM_SETCURSOR. D3D presents straight
// over it (FE's window has no WS_CLIPCHILDREN), so the screen looks right and
// only the pointer and hit-testing see the window.
//
// Before placement FE had it at (560,284) in the owner's client coordinates,
// i.e. wholly outside the 800x600 client, so a video window FE never hides was
// harmless. Moving it INTO the client -- and forcing WS_VISIBLE on it -- made its
// lifetime our problem, and we also hold a reference that keeps the graph (and
// its window) alive after the title lets go. So when the clip is over, hide it.
//
// Only HIDES, never shows, moves or stops anything: the renderer's own AutoShow
// brings the window back if the title runs the graph again, and put_away re-arms
// once the graph is seen playing, so a replay is put away at its end too.

// d3d8hook.cpp -- Direct3D 8 interposition. This is where the games live.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. dxhook.cpp measured the Viewer shell and found it to be
// a WINDOWED DirectDraw app at 640x480 that never calls SetDisplayMode, and the
// ChangeDisplaySettings* trace came back empty across ~10 live sessions. Both
// negatives were real; we were simply watching the wrong API. Reading the import
// tables of the CONTENT modules settles it:
//
//     app.dll                  DDRAW!DirectDrawCreateEx      (the Viewer shell)
//     TM.dll                   d3d8!Direct3DCreate8          (Tetra Master)
//     FFXiMain.dll             d3d8!Direct3DCreate8
//     FE_Client.dll            d3d8!Direct3DCreate8          (Fantasy Earth)
//     FrontMissionOnline.dll   d3d9!Direct3DCreate9
//
// The shell is DirectDraw; every actual GAME is Direct3D. D3D8 changes the
// display mode inside CreateDevice when Windowed == FALSE, and it does that
// through the runtime and driver -- never through ChangeDisplaySettings and
// never through DirectDraw. That is exactly the shape of the evidence we had.
//
// It also predicts the second half of the report: a 640x480 fullscreen device on
// a larger desktop puts the rendered image and the OS pointer in two different
// coordinate spaces, which is the "mouse misplaced and over-sensitive" symptom.
// One cause, two faces.
//
// THE ABI PROBLEM, AND HOW THIS FILE HANDLES IT. d3d8.h ships in no current SDK
// and not even in the June 2010 DirectX SDK, so the interfaces below are
// declared by hand and a wrong vtable slot index would be a silent crash -- the
// same failure mode that cost a session on PolContentsCom's stolen slot 3.
// So nothing is patched until the layout is PROVEN at runtime:
// validate_d3d8() calls slot 4 (GetAdapterCount) and slot 8
// (GetAdapterDisplayMode) and requires the adapter count to be sane AND the
// reported display mode to equal the real desktop mode from
// EnumDisplaySettingsW. If the vtable were shifted, slot 8 would not hand back
// the true desktop resolution. The device vtable is checked the same way against
// its own slot 8. A failed check logs and disables the hook; it never guesses.
//
// Delivery is a VTABLE patch, not a wrapper object: we replace exactly one
// function pointer (CreateDevice, and later Reset) in d3d8's own vtable and keep
// the original. The client goes on using the genuine interface pointer. That
// means one correct slot index instead of a 100-method wrapper, and it covers
// TM, FFXI and Fantasy Earth at once because they all share d3d8's vtable.

// literals `PlayOnlineMask`, `PlayOnlineMaskEU`, `PlayOnlineMaskUS` are UTF-16
// strings in pol.exe, and its HWND is what polcore's SetMaskWindowHandle
// (IPOLCoreCom slot 22) receives. It exists to cover the desktop during
// transitions, and while a game held an EXCLUSIVE fullscreen device it never
// mattered: the device covered everything. Windowed, the mask is simply a
// screen-sized black window sitting on top of the game -- which is a black
// screen that still shows the game correctly in the taskbar thumbnail, and
// swallows every click. Measured on Tetra Master, 2026-08-12.
//
// Only ever touches windows owned by THIS process.
//
// WARNING: IF A GAME RUNS WITH NO WINDOW AND NO TASKBAR BUTTON, IT IS NOT THIS.
// The natural suspicion is that mask handling got greedy and hid the game too.
// It cannot: the three class names above are matched EXACTLY, mode 2 (default)
// ALIGNS the mask rather than hiding it, and the WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW /
// ~WS_EX_APPWINDOW restyle below is applied only to a window that matched.
//
// The real mechanism, measured 2026-08-15: **Tetra Master's window is born
// hidden.** At device creation the log reads
//     focus window BEFORE class="Tetra Master" style=84000000 visible=0
// -- WS_POPUP|WS_CLIPSIBLINGS, not visible -- and it is fit_window() that turns
// it into 14CF0000 / visible=1 at (512,265). So the window only ever becomes
// visible as a SIDE EFFECT of the d3d device being created. A launch that
// stalls BEFORE CreateDevice leaves a live process with a window that was never
// shown: nothing on screen, nothing in the taskbar.
//
// Diagnose it in one grep, do not theorise: count Direct3DCreate8/CreateDevice
// in the run's polshim.<pid>.log (INSTALL tree, not build/ -- see the ini note).
// A run that showed a window had 3; the invisible run had 0 and its log stopped
// right after `[titletag]`, i.e. the game never reached graphics init at all.
//
// Run the mask work OFF the game's thread.
//
// Anything that touches another thread's window can block, and blocking inside
// CreateDevice means the game never gets a device. Belt and braces alongside
// SWP_ASYNCWINDOWPOS: even if some call still stalls, it stalls a throwaway
// thread and the game carries on.

// --- DirectShow video window adoption ---------------------------------------
//
// A title that plays an FMV through DirectShow gets a windowed video renderer:
// quartz makes a top-level window of class "VideoRenderer" and the game is
// supposed to place it over itself (IVideoWindow::put_Owner + SetWindowPosition).
// A game written for exclusive fullscreen computes that placement from the
// fullscreen rect it believes it owns -- so once we force it windowed, it can
// leave the video parked at DirectShow's DEFAULT 320x240 at (52,52), nowhere
// near the game.
//
// Measured on FMO, 2026-08-14: VMR-9 was PRESENTING FRAMES the whole time (the
// swap-chain counter proves it), into a 320x240 window off to one side, while
// the game window showed the black/white screen the user reported. So the movie
// worked; only its window was in the wrong place.
//
// The rule is deliberately conservative: adopt ONLY a video window that does not
// intersect the game's client area at all. Fantasy Earth positions its own video
// correctly (measured: it walks itself to 800x533 over the game), and this must
// not disturb a title that already gets it right.
//
// "VideoRenderer" IS NOT THE ONLY CLASS -- MEASURED 2026-08-17.
//
// Enumerating a live pol.exe's own windows found the FMV window sitting there as
// class "FilterGraphWindow", title "ActiveMovie Window", at DirectShow's default
// 320x240 near the origin -- and NOT ONE window of class "VideoRenderer" in the
// process. That single-name test is why a session showing the fault logged no
// [vid] lines at all: the matcher never saw the window, so nothing downstream of
// it -- neither the old intersection guard nor the size test that replaced it --
// ever got a say. Both classes are the same thing under different renderers
// (legacy Video Renderer vs VMR-7/9 in windowed mode), so match a LIST.
//
// It also explains "the logo is drawn twice": an un-adopted 320x240 movie window
// is a second top-level window sitting ON the game, playing the same title
// sequence small and soft next to the game's own sharp copy. One fault, two
// reports (the doubled logo and the fraction-sized FMV) -- fitting the window
// answers both.
//
// A candidate must be VISIBLE. The old code force-showed whatever it adopted
// (SWP_SHOWWINDOW), which was harmless while only a playing renderer could
// match; with FilterGraphWindow in the list it is not -- the graph window
// outlives the clip and sits hidden at 320x240 between FMVs (that is exactly the
// state it was measured in), and adopting it would paste a dead black rectangle
// over the whole game. Hidden means "not playing": skip it and re-check on the

    // the movie. Using the outer one silently declares every unplaced movie 4:3,
    // which is right for FMO by luck and wrong for anything else.

    // The client rect of a video window that is actually PLAYING is the video,

// --- WHO HIDES THE POINTER OVER FANTASY EARTH ------------------------------
//
// MEASURED 2026-08-25 with an external cursor probe, while FE sat with no pointer
// over its client area:
//
//     window under it = 0x009717B6 class=MainWindow   Fantasy Earth
//     visible  = HIDDEN  (display count is negative)
//     class cur= 0x71250591 (not a standard shape -- the title's own)
//
// So it is the COUNT, not the shape -- and the shape it is failing to draw is
// FE's OWN cursor, registered on FE's own window class. Fantasy Earth is the one
// title that drives the OS pointer itself (FE_Client.dll imports SetCursor,
// SetCursorPos, GetCursorPos, ShowCursor, ClipCursor, LoadCursorA and
// RegisterClassExA; TM.dll's entire user32 surface is CallNextHookEx), so its
// in-game pointer IS the Windows cursor and a negative display count erases it.
//
// The reported repro is a STATE TRANSITION, not a machine: fresh launch shows
// the pointer, minimise+restore brings it back, and mousing away from the window
// and returning loses it. The shim's own nc_cursor_show/restore pair is NOT the
// cause -- it never logged a single raise in that session, so it never took a
// boost and never gave one back.
//
// That leaves an unbalanced ShowCursor(FALSE) somewhere in pol.exe or FE itself,
// riding the activation cycle. This hook answers WHICH, the same way the [cap]
// hooks answered the capture question: it logs the caller's module and offset and
// passes every call straight through. WARNING: Do NOT "fix" this by forcing the count
// back up before the writer is named -- that is a debug lever, not a fix, and it
// would hide whichever call is missing its partner.

//
// nosteal exists because these titles re-grab the foreground mid-session and
// yank you out of whatever you were doing. But it was written as "refuse any
// call that takes focus from another process", and that description also fits
// the ONE call that has to be allowed: the game raising its own window for the
// first time, at launch. If you alt-tab while a title loads -- which is the
// normal thing to do, since it takes several seconds -- the presentation call
// arrives while some other app is foreground, gets refused, and the game sits
// at the bottom of the z-order with a valid, visible, unreachable window.
//
// Observed exactly that way (polshim.507768.log): calls #1 and #2 succeeded
// while the Viewer still had focus, then
//     [foc] SetForegroundWindow(02D211A2)  <-- WOULD STEAL FROM ANOTHER APP  [call #3]
// and the window was left at z-rank 95 of ~98. Nothing covered it; the audit
// even confirmed "window at the game's centre point = the game -- good". It had
// simply never been raised.
//
// The exemption is deliberately narrow, because a wide one is just nosteal off:
//   * the target must be OUR OWN game window (not any window, not the Viewer's);
//   * the game window must never yet have reached the foreground -- one raise,
//     not a licence to grab focus repeatedly;
//   * and it must be within d3d_nosteal_grace ms of that window first appearing,
//     so a title running for an hour can never invoke it.
// Once the game has been foreground even once, every later grab is refused
// exactly as before -- which is the behaviour nosteal was actually built for.

// CallNextHookEx, and polcore only SetWindowsHookExA/CallNextHookEx (the hook
// plumbing). That is why FMO shows the same symptoms: it is ONE piece of shared
// shell code, not a per-game bug.
//
// Its mouse-message handler at app.dll+0x27886A reads:

// --- GetWindowRect: the actual cursor bug -----------------------------------
//
// REVERSED from pol.exe, and this is the one that matters. The game process
// holds pol.exe + PolHook.dll + polcore.dll + TM.dll and **no app.dll**, so the
// app.dll cursor code reversed earlier cannot be involved in a game session.
// pol.exe owns it, in a single routine -- the only GetCursorPos call site in the
// whole binary:
//
//     00409FDC  mov  eax, [ebp+0x14]        ; the game window
//     00409FE5  call [GetWindowRect]        ; <-- the WINDOW rect
//     00409FF0  call [GetCursorPos]         ; screen position
//     0040A006  jmp  [ecx*4 + 0x40A454]     ; 8 aspect/scale modes
//     0040A00D  fild/fidiv                  ; aspect = w / h
//     0040A022  lea edi,[esi+esi*4]; shl 7  ; * 640
//     0040A03F  imul edx, edx, 0x1E0        ; * 480
//
// It maps the screen cursor into the title's 640x480 space using the WINDOW
// rectangle. Fullscreen that is harmless: a borderless full-screen window's
// window rect IS its client area. But fit_window gives the window a caption and
// a sizing border to make it draggable and closable, and pol.exe then treats
// that frame as part of the play field:
//
//     window (312,100) 656x519   vs   client (320,131) 640x480
//
// -> origin off by the frame (8,31), scale off by 656/640 and 519/480, and
//    re-derived every frame, which is the runaway rather than a fixed offset.
//
// So: tell pol.exe the truth about the drawable area. For the game window only,
// GetWindowRect returns the CLIENT rect in screen coordinates. That keeps the
// caption, the X and the sizing border while making the mapping exact -- the
// alternative (dropping the frame so window == client) would fix the pointer by
// taking away the window controls that were asked for.

// WHY THIS IS NEEDED, measured 2026-08-12. The IAT patch DID land -- the log
// says `[iat] hooked d3d8:Direct3DCreate8 in TM.dll` -- and the hook still never
// fired. The reason is in TM.dll's section table: its names are NULLED
// (`,,,,.rsrc,,.data,.data`), i.e. TM.dll is POL1/ASProtect-packed like the rest
// of the client. The packer's stub re-resolves imports at runtime, which
// overwrites the slot we patched at DLL-load time. Patching a packed module's
// IAT is a race we lose.
//
// So patch the SOURCE instead of the call site: rewrite d3d8.dll's own export
// table entry. That is the same mechanism inject.cpp already uses for
// DllGetClassObject, and its rationale applies verbatim -- every resolution path
// (a loader bind, GetProcAddress, LdrGetProcedureAddress, a packer stub
// re-resolving late) reads the EAT, so all of them land on our thunk. We install
// it at startup, long before TM.dll loads, so the packer's own resolution is
// caught too.
//
// EAT entries are 32-bit RVAs added to the module base. In a 32-bit address
// space (hook - base) as a DWORD round-trips correctly even when the hook sits
// below d3d8's base, because base + RVA wraps mod 2^32 back to the hook.

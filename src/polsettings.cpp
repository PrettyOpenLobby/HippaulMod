// polsettings.cpp -- the in-game shim settings dialog.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// Every shim option lives in polshim.ini, and on a Steam Deck editing that file means
// leaving Game Mode for the desktop, finding the Proton prefix, and typing into a text
// editor with a touchscreen keyboard. That is most of the friction in a Deck session,
// and it is why options like [regfix] enable sat at their default on a machine whose
// owner wanted them on. This puts the same options behind a chord.
//
// WHAT IT DOES
//
// A watcher thread polls for two chords and opens a dialog built at RUNTIME from
// shim_options() -- the same table iniheal writes -- so adding a row there gives you
// both the ini key and the dialog control with no work here.
//
//   keyboard   [settings] hotkey=ctrl+shift+s     (GetAsyncKeyState, no global hook)
//   gamepad    [settings] pad_chord=back+start    (XInput, resolved dynamically)
//
// The dialog runs on the watcher thread with its own message loop and window class, so
// it never blocks or re-enters the Viewer's UI thread. Saving writes only the values
// that actually changed, via WritePrivateProfileString -- the same file iniheal and
// install.sh's ini_heal maintain, so all three agree by construction.
//
// WHY GetAsyncKeyState AND NOT A KEYBOARD HOOK: a WH_KEYBOARD_LL hook is process-wide
// and its callback runs on whatever thread pumped the message, so a slow frame in the
// Viewer stalls every keystroke on the system. Polling at 16 Hz costs nothing, cannot
// wedge the input stack, and needs no extra privileges under Proton.
//
// IMPORTANT: KNOWN LIMIT -- READ BEFORE RELYING ON IT: the Viewer's shell is DirectDraw and may
// hold the display EXCLUSIVELY. Over an exclusive-fullscreen surface a normal top-level
// window can be invisible even though it exists and has focus, which reads exactly like
// "the chord did nothing". This is the same caveat that governs polctl's screenshots.
// If the chord appears dead, check the log for the `[settings] opened`
// line first -- if that line is there, the dialog IS open and this is a compositing
// problem, not an input one. Now MEASURED against the shell, not merely suspected.
//
// IMPORTANT: AND IT IS WORSE THAN "INVISIBLE" -- MEASURED ON A STEAM DECK, 2026-08-15: pressing
// the chord inside FFXI CRASHED THE TITLE. FFXI holds an exclusive fullscreen Direct3D
// device; creating and activating a top-level window takes the display from it, the
// device is lost, and the game dies. So the chord is now a NO-OP while such a device is
// live (see exclusive_display_blocks_us below) and says so in the log. Note that
// [dx] d3d_windowed=1 is NOT the workaround the old note above implied: for FFXI
// specifically it black-screens the title (measured 2026-08-15). Use the chord
// in the Viewer shell, which is windowed. [settings] fullscreen_ok=1 opts back in.
//
// RESOLVED: 2026-08-24: d3d_windowed NOW DEFAULTS TO 1, so on a stock install there should be
// no exclusive device in the process at all and the chord should work everywhere,
// including inside FFXI. exclusive_display_blocks_us is NOT removed -- it is the guard
// for a title someone has deliberately put back with [dx] d3d_windowed_except, and for
// the add-on-core case where FFXI's device is left alone regardless. What changed is
// that it should now be the rare path rather than the FFXI path.
//
// WARNING: The FFXI caveat above is still live and still unretracted: nobody has watched FFXI
// run windowed since the Deck measurement that black-screened it. If it does, the fix
// is d3d_windowed_except=FFXiMain.dll (the "Titles left fullscreen" dropdown), which
// also brings this guard back into play for that title.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------- controller mapper
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE WINDOW AND NOT THREE MORE ROWS IN THE OPTION TABLE
//
// The old controller options were `btn_ok=-1` style TEXT FIELDS holding a DirectInput
// button INDEX. To use them you had to already know the index space, already know which
// slot the client reads for confirm, and then relaunch to find out whether you were
// right. Every one of those is a thing the machine knows and the user does not, and the
// feature failed twice in a row on exactly that gap.
//
// So this window asks the only question a user can actually answer -- "press the button
// you want for Confirm" -- and shows, live, what the client will be handed as a result.
// padmap.cpp applies each change on the client's very next poll, so the shell behind
// this window is testable WITHOUT closing it and without relaunching, which is the
// whole point: bind, look, press, adjust.
//
// Cancel restores the bindings that were live when the window opened, so experimenting
// is free. Save writes them to polshim.ini.

// bitmap stretch, correct DirectInput cursor mapping. This dialog, though, is
// hand-laid in 96-DPI pixel constants (LY_*, three CreateFontW heights, ~15
// bare literals), so under that context a 200% monitor draws it at half size
// -- "incredibly small on a super high res monitor", reported 2026-09-02.
//
// Scaling all 69 LY_* sites is the big, risky fix. The contained one: make
// JUST THIS THREAD DPI-unaware while the dialog lives, so Windows scales the
// window for us. GDISCALED (-5, Win10 1809+) keeps GDI text crisp; plain
// UNAWARE (-1) is the fallback. The context binds at window CREATION and the
// message pump runs inside the scope, so the prompt / report / padmap children
// opened from WM_COMMAND inherit it too. SPI_GETWORKAREA virtualizes under an
// unaware context, so pane_geometry()'s fit arithmetic stays consistent by
// construction. With [dx] dpi_aware=0 the process is unaware already and this
// whole thing is a harmless no-op. Resolved dynamically: the API is Win10
// 1607+; where it is absent nothing declared awareness either, so there is

    // inject.cpp runs iniheal() and THEN inimigrate(). On a fresh install iniheal
    // writes the CURRENT defaults and [polshim] config_rev is absent -- which reads
    // as 0, so inimigrate walks EVERY migration ever written, including rev 1, over
    // a file iniheal filled in seconds earlier. Any migration whose `was` happens to
    // equal a key's PRESENT-DAY default therefore fires on a machine built today and
    // silently un-does that default, for ever, on every new install.
    //
    // That is not hypothetical: rev 1 carried d3d_windowed_except "" -> FFXiMain.dll.
    // It was harmless for as long as the healed default was FFXiMain.dll (the `was`
    // could never match a fresh file). The moment the default became empty, rev 1
    // matched it -- so shipping "windowed by default" would have put FFXI straight
    // back to fullscreen on precisely the installs it was meant to reach, with the
    // migration log line as the only trace. Rev 1's row is deleted; this is the check
    // that catches the next one.

// iniheal.cpp -- the CURATED OPTION TABLE, and the startup heal that writes it.
//
// One table, two consumers, so they can never drift:
//   * iniheal()      -- on startup, add any MISSING key to the install's polshim.ini
//                       with its default, so a new shim option becomes visible and
//                       editable on a deployed install (which never runs build.bat's
//                       merge-ini.ps1). Each key is written only if ABSENT -- checked
//                       with a sentinel -- so a value you set is NEVER touched.
//   * polsettings.cpp -- draws the in-game settings dialog straight off this table,
//                       which is why the rows carry a type + label as well.
//
// This is the set a user might actually flip; internal/dev-only keys (probes, capture,
// tabletrace, ...) are deliberately left out so a normal ini stays clean and the
// dialog stays short. Comments are not written (the dist ini template documents them).
//
// dist/install.sh has a THIRD implementation of the same rule (ini_heal, in awk) for
// the keys the DLL has not seen yet -- it heals from the shipped template at install
// time, before this code ever runs. Same semantics: add absent, never overwrite.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// TWO RULES ADDED 2026-08-17, both learned from the same failure
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A user moved to a second computer and found the Tetra Master mouse broken and
// Fantasy Earth mis-patching -- both of which had been fixed months earlier --
// and could not say which settings had fixed them. They were right not to know:
// the fixes were in dist/polshim.ini and NOWHERE ELSE. An install that never
// received that template (or received an older one) fell back to the COMPILED
// defaults, and the compiled defaults for [dx] enable, d3d_enable, dinput_enable,
// dinput_mouseabs and [polshim] patches are all OFF.
//
// RULE 1 -- IF IT IS PART OF THE TESTED CONFIGURATION, IT IS A ROW HERE.
// Being documented in the shipped template is not delivery: the template is
// written only when an install has none. A key that must be on for a title to
// work belongs in this table with the value we actually test, so a stale install
// heals into the working configuration instead of quietly running without it.
//
// RULE 2 -- LABEL THE OUTCOME, NOT THE MECHANISM.
// "dinput_mouseabs" is what the code calls it. "Tetra Master: the card cursor
// lands where you point" is what the user is looking for. Where a fix is several
// keys, it gets ONE row (OPT_PACK) and the members go hidden -- nobody should
// have to know that a working mouse in one game is four ini keys.

#include "polshim.h"

// A GROUP'S `choices` IS ITS SIDEBAR NAME. Headings read in place ("Logging in, and

  // WRITES the game's own cursor variable (two int16s at a fixed RVA, which the
  // game clamps itself) instead of steering it with deltas, so it lands exactly
  // where you point at any window size; freecursor swallows the warp so the
  // pointer is never captured. Neither does anything without dinput_enable,

  // is unanswerable when the fix is invisible. Reported 2026-08-17.
  //
  // DirectInput UNACQUIRES a FOREGROUND device the moment its window stops being
  // foreground, and a buffered reader then just sees an empty queue -- no error,
  // nothing. Measured on FE: it acquires NONEXCLUSIVE|FOREGROUND, the first
  // GetDeviceData returns 31 events and every call after it returns 0 for ever.

  // A control whose only function is to break a title is not a setting, it is a
  // trap with a label. Same reasoning that RETIRED d3d_fitwindow and hid
  // d3d_fitvideo. The key is still healed and still read, so a diagnosing hand

  // Deliberately ONE row, sitting immediately under dinput_background,

  // DISCL_FOREGROUND to DISCL_BACKGROUND, which is literally "keep feeding
  // this device when the window is not focused". It cannot simply be turned
  // off -- off means FE's clicks stop working at all -- so the gate withholds
  // the DATA instead and leaves the acquisition alone. inputgate.cpp has the
  // full argument, and applies the same rule to the two SE-owned paths
  // (app.dll's GetCursorPos poll and SE's system-wide WH_MOUSE hook), which
  // is why this is not a dinput_* key.
  // THE CLOSE BOX. A windowed title has an X and SE never wrote any behaviour
  // for one -- these games were left through their own in-game menus. Before
  // 2026-08-26 it silently ended the title and dropped you back to the Viewer,
  // which is right about half the time; the rest of the time "close" means

  // complaint is one sentence -- "the game still takes my input when I am not

  // fixed the mouse and left the keyboard reads, to the person who reported it,

// ===========================================================================
// MIGRATION -- the half iniheal cannot do
// ===========================================================================
//
// Read polshim.h's note on inimigrate() first; this is the table it walks.
//
// EVERY ENTRY HERE IS EVIDENCE, NOT AN OPINION. `was` lists values that THIS
// PROJECT shipped as a default -- in dist/polshim.ini, polshim.ini.production or
// the table above -- and has since replaced. That is the whole admission test,
// and it is what makes the rewrite defensible: we are correcting our own old
// answer on an install that never got the new one, not overruling a choice.
//
// The rule it deliberately does NOT cover: a key whose COMPILED literal was once
// wrong but whose shipped templates were always right (dinput_mousescale 100,
// dinput_abs_clip 1, d3d_clientrect 1). A stale literal is only ever reached when
// the key is ABSENT from the ini -- in which case iniheal writes the current
// default and there is nothing to migrate. A key physically present at that value
// got there by hand, and a hand-set value is exactly what this must not touch.
//
// TO ADD ONE: bump POLSHIM_CONFIG_REV, give the new entries that rev, and say in
// `why` what BREAKS on the old value -- that string is logged and shown to the
// user, so it is the only explanation anybody gets.
//
// IMPORTANT: TWO PROPERTIES OF THIS TABLE THAT ARE EASY TO MISS, both learned the hard way on
// 2026-08-24 while making windowed mode the default. A sabotage run proved both.
//
// 1. A rev-1 ROW CAN REACH A MACHINE BUILT TODAY. inject.cpp runs iniheal() and THEN
//    inimigrate(). A brand-new ini has no config_rev, which reads as 0, so EVERY
//    migration ever written is walked over a file iniheal filled in moments earlier
//    with today's defaults. So a row whose `was` equals a key's PRESENT-DAY default
//    fires on every new install and silently un-does that default, for ever.
//    => WHENEVER YOU CHANGE AN iniheal DEFAULT, grep this table for that key and
//       delete or retarget any row whose `was` is the value you just adopted.
//       Changing d3d_windowed_except's default to L"" made the rev-1 row that read
//       L"" -> L"FFXiMain.dll" start matching fresh installs, which would have undone
//       the entire windowed-by-default change on exactly the machines it was for.
//
// 2. ORDER IN THIS ARRAY IS LOAD-BEARING, AND IT IS NOT THE SAME AS rev ORDER. The
//    walk is a single top-to-bottom pass, so when two rows touch one key BOTH can run
//    in the same pass and the LAST one listed wins -- regardless of rev. That is why
//    the newest rev goes at the TOP: a superseded older row sitting below it would
//    quietly overwrite the new value. (This is also why the sabotage run above only
//    reproduced the bug once the old row was put back at the BOTTOM, where it really
//    lived; from the top it was harmlessly corrected by the newer row below it.)
//
// polsettings.cpp's selftest "a NEW install survives the migration pass with its
// defaults intact" pins property 1 for every keyed option at once. It is the check to
// run after touching either this table or a default in g_opts.

  //    `polcryptInit K=<hex> IV=<hex> sbox=<hex>` -- the Blowfish SESSION KEY -- into
  //    the shim log on every login. A diagnostic that ships ON must be safe ON. It
  //    is still exactly the right switch for a stuck login.
  //
  // 2. THE FANTASY EARTH TEARDOWN GUARD GETS PROMOTED. Its row carried an explicit
  //    promotion condition -- "flip to 1 as its default once a live run past the logos
  //    confirms it" -- written when it was byte-verified but unmeasured. The run is
  //    recorded: Deck, 2026-08-20. Guard applied,
  //    FE_Client+0x2AC5C4 never faulted again, FE reached live world-connect, and the
  //    remaining death is a different, later wall. Wine-gated, so a no-op on Windows.
  //
  // Admission test satisfied for both: `1` and `0` are the values this project shipped
  // as those rows' defaults, not values a person typed.
  //
  // WARNING: Trap check (see the notes above this table), done for both keys: neither `0` nor
  // `1` is now the *current* default of any OTHER row these could collide with, and
  // no earlier rev touches `[auth] log` or `[dx] fe_teardown_guard` -- so nothing
  // below can undo either on a fresh install. The selftest "a NEW install survives the

  // WINDOWED MODE BECOMES THE DEFAULT, AND IT HAS TO BE A MIGRATION.
  //
  // The reported symptom is not "I would prefer a window": it is that an exclusive
  // fullscreen device fights so hard for the display that the game cannot be LEFT.
  // An exclusive device owns the screen, so alt-tab, the settings chord (a NO-OP
  // while one is live -- polsettings.cpp exclusive_display_blocks_us), overlays and
  // recovery from sleep are all things it takes away.
  //
  // A default change alone would reach NOBODY. d3d_windowed shipped as an explicit
  // `0` in the iniheal table and in all three templates (polshim.ini,
  // polshim.ini.production, dist/polshim.ini), so every install that exists carries
  // that 0 physically, and iniheal only ever ADDS absent keys. Same for the except
  // list at FFXiMain.dll. This is [[shim-old-default-migration]], the failure mode
  // that has now cost this project four separate "the setting does nothing" reports.
  //
  // Admission test satisfied for both: 0 and FFXiMain.dll are values this project
  // SHIPPED as row defaults, not values a person typed. Someone who sets either back
  // after this rev keeps their choice -- config_rev only steps once.
  //
  // WARNING: Two more halves of this change are NOT here, because a migration cannot make
  // them: the profile rows in profiles.cpp (FFXI and FMO were PW_FULLSCREEN, which
  // outranked d3d_windowed entirely) ship in CODE, and the rev-1 row that used to add
  // FFXiMain.dll to this list had to be DELETED rather than reversed -- see the note

  // FE's own OPENING_MOVIE=0 does not stop the graph being built. fmv_skip=4
  // refuses the graph at creation so the title takes its no-movie path.
  //
  // This has to be a migration, not just a default change: fmv_skip shipped as an
  // explicit 0 in the option table, so EVERY install healed before today carries
  // that 0 and a new default would reach none of them.
  //
  // Admission test satisfied: 0 is a value this project shipped as the row default

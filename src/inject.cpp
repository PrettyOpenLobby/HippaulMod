// The Viewer restores any modified component from its patchfiles copy at
// startup, so file replacement cannot survive a launch. This reaches the same
// place without disk changes, and covers the two things a naive GetProcAddress
// hook misses:
//
//   1. EAT patching. We patch the target component's *export table* entry for
//      DllGetClassObject when the module loads. Every resolution path -- plain
//      GetProcAddress, ntdll!LdrGetProcedureAddress used by COM activation,
//      anything -- reads the EAT, so all of them land on our thunk. (A raw
//      GetProcAddress IAT hook misses the COM path, which is exactly how the
//      Viewer obtains polcore.)
//
//   2. Child-process propagation. pol.exe spawns the real Viewer as a child.
//      We IAT-hook CreateProcessW/A so every process we're in injects its
//      children too; coverage becomes recursive from the launcher down.
//
// No inline hooks and no length disassembler anywhere: exports and imports are
// patched by value, and LdrRegisterDllNotification catches modules (and thus
// EAT targets) that appear after we're in.

    // WHY IT EARNS ITS PLACE. "Is the shim doing this?" is the question this
    // project answers wrong most often, and answering it used to mean pulling
    // the injector, which does NOT disable the self-loading COM proxy inside
    // the install tree -- so "I ran without the shim" was routinely false.
    // With this, the answer is one ini line and one log line.
    //
    // IT LOGS, AND THAT IS THE POINT. A silent bypass would be worse than no
    // bypass: this ledger is full of fixes that never ran and were reported as
    // if they had. The line below is the PROOF that the shim stood down, and
    // it carries the build number so a stale DLL cannot masquerade as a bypass.
    //
    // THE KEY IS `bypass`, NOT ANOTHER `enable`. Deliberate: a session was
    // lost to reading one section's `enable=0` as another's, so this name
    // exists nowhere else in the ini and cannot be confused with a subsystem
    // switch. Section-scoped to [polshim], the section that owns the DLL.
    //
    // Placed AFTER log_open and BEFORE autoupdate_boot_guard on purpose: the
    // guard rewrites the DLL on disk, which is a shim function acting on
    // itself and precisely the thing you want stopped while bisecting.
    //
    // ONE THING SURVIVES, DELIBERATELY: the settings watcher. Without it a
    // bypass ticked in the dialog could only be undone by hand-editing the ini
    // on a machine that may not have a keyboard in front of it -- a Deck in
    // Game Mode -- so the switch would be a trap rather than a tool. The
    // way back was asked for and it is the right call: an instrument
    // you cannot put down does not get picked up.
    //
    // WARNING: SO THE MARKER MUST NOT SAY "as if the shim were not installed" -- it
    // said exactly that until the watcher was kept, and it would have been a
    // lie by one thread. It names what is still running instead. What that
    // thread does is bounded and worth stating: `polsettings_start` resolves
    // XInput and polls the keyboard and pad every 60 ms on its own thread. It
    // installs NO hook, patches nothing, and touches no client memory; the pad

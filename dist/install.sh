# --- d3d8 -> DXVK: the one Proton setting that decides POL's framerate ------------
#
# Every stock Proton serves Direct3D 8 through wined3d (OpenGL) UNLESS
# PROTON_DXVK_D3D8=1. DXVK's d3d8 front-end (d8vk) ships inside the same Proton --
# it is merely OPT-IN. Every POL title that matters here is d3d8 (Tetra Master,
# Fantasy Earth, FFXI), so all of them take the slow path by default, while FMO --
# the one d3d9 title, and the one that always felt healthiest on a Deck -- has been
# on DXVK the whole time. Measured on a Deck 2026-09-07: Tetra Master issues
# 320-420 draw calls per FRAME and `wined3d_cs` is the hottest thread in the process.
#
# Identify which path a prefix is on by SIZE, in compatdata/<appid>/pfx/drive_c/
# windows/syswow64/ (a 32-bit title loads syswow64, not system32):
#     wined3d builtin d3d8.dll  ~313 KB        <- the slow path
#     Proton 11's DXVK d3d8.dll  ~1,683 KB     <- what we want
#
# IMPORTANT: THE KNOB IS PER-PROTON-INSTALL, AND SWITCHING PROTON SILENTLY LOSES IT.
# It was set by hand on 2026-08-20 in "Proton 10.0/user_settings.py". The title later
# moved to Proton 11.0, whose user_settings.py EXISTS but does not carry the key --
# so the fix quietly stopped running for eleven days and nobody could see it. That is
# exactly why this writes to EVERY Proton install it finds rather than the active one.
#
# Steam Launch Options would also work and are deliberately NOT used: this project
# keeps them empty (a malformed `PROTON_LOG=%command%` left there once cost an
# evening), and user_settings.py is the documented control on these machines.

Just launch the game normally -- the title bar should end with '[HippaulMod v...]'.
  - Server:      baked into polshim.ini (change it by re-running, or edit [redirect] server=).
  - Controller:  on by default; [inputmode] mode=off for kb/mouse, swap_confirm=1 to swap A/B.
  - Speed:       d3d8 -> DXVK enabled in Proton (Tetra Master / FFXI / Fantasy Earth).
                 Re-run this after switching Proton version -- the setting lives in the
                 Proton folder, so a switch loses it. Opt out with --no-dxvk-d3d8.
  - Revert:      ./install.sh --revert
